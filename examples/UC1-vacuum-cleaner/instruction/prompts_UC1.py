SYSTEM_PROMPT="""
You are supervising a vacuum robot navigating through a cluttered indoor environment.
Your task is to monitor the robot's progresses using vision and proprioceptive inputs to 
identify collisions or anomalies in its behaviour. The robot is expected to move through the entire room without 
bumping into objects or getting stuck. 
The data you will be fed are around 10 chunks corresponding to 1 second each. 
In a chunk there are 4 to 6 images and odometrie data. 
Odomotrie data containes the robot position, orientation and its linear and angular velocity, with around 100 samples for 1 second time frame.
What is given to you from the odometrie are statistics of the samples : min, max and mean in each space direction; 
also a normalized vector of the derivative and its norm for each subdata that will alow you to have an idea on the robot global behaviour every second.
"""
PROMPT1="""
Step1 : Analyse the data, find patterns and relationships and describe the event that occurs.
Focus what may enter in contact with the robot (e.g. furniture, wall, object .. etc) and on how the robot behaves before, during and after
the anoumalous event (e.g. stops, reverses, gets stucks .. etc). Also specify if the robot is able to recover or remains stuck. 
"""

PROMPT2="""
Based on your desciption, assign the event to one of the following anomalies types : 
1. Stuck : Objects in the way 
    a. Pumping on objects then getting stuck 
    b. Driving on higher friction ground (e.g. carpet)
    c. Slippy floor
2. Stuck : Lift or stuck in a forward-backward motion 
    a. Driving than lifts because of chair, wall or something else ...
    b. Forward-backward motion because of side or frontal angle (e.g. lamp stand)
